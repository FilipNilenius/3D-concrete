Numerical model of heterogeneous concrete in 3D for finite element analysis of transport- and mechanical problems, and computational homogenization.

The model has been published here:

https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00466-014-0998-0

https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00466-014-1105-2

Please cite either of the two published papers if you use the model as a means for your own work.
